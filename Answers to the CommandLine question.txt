Answers to the CommandLine 
For the countries Italy, Spain, France, England, and the United States, report the following (using the information scraped in point 1.3):
1. How many places can be found in each country?
2. How many people, on average, have visited the places in each country?
3. How many people in total want to visit the places in each country?

Using the command grep on shell we can extract places of each country from the dataframe and with wc -l count them.
237 : places in Italy
120 : places in Spain
351 : places in France 
520 : places in England 
4016 : places in the United States 

Then we use cut and grep to extract values we need from each column to be able to alculate the average... 
395.407 : number of people (on average) who visited Italy
498.541 : number of people (on average) who visited Spain
452.286 : number of people (on average) who visited France
500.586 : number of people (on average) who visited Englnd 
461.552 : number of people (on average) who visited the US

...and the sum of what we need 
165962 : number of people who want to visit Italy in total 
63167 : number of people who want to visit Spain in total 
192485 : number of people who want to visit France in total 
370450 : number of people who want to visit England in total 
4028834 : number of people who want to visit the US in total
